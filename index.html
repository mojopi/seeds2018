            </div>
            <hr> At a camp on a lake in Maine, mayflies molt on pines. They shed their skins to grow and re-make themselves.
            <br>
            <br>We too come to this camp to grow. Connected by the vast differences between us, we change with each other.
            <br>
            <br> We're Palestinian, Israeli, Egyptian, Jordanian, Pakistani, Indian, and American. For three weeks, we live, work, play, and are in constant conversation with each other. We hear each other's stories. We cry together. We laugh together. We wear the same green t-shirts, eat the same food, and sleep in bunks next to each other. On a small plot of land, our worlds and identities clash and come together to make something new.
            <br>
            <br> The relationships that grow here make us more human — more alive to each other's sufferings, humiliations, idiosyncracies, habits, and joys. In coming to know each other, we also come to know ourselves — our powers, biases, values, privileges, and the traumas we carry.
            <br>
            <br>I tried to capture some of moments that struck me during our three weeks together in 2018. Click on the sketches below to get a sense of some conversations and memories that I've been carrying with me.

We all start arguing. A man and I get into it. He gestures in a way that I interpret as dismissive. I try not to, but I begin to cry. We talk about gender and gendered responses to things. People are annoyed at the facilitator for facilitating so heavily. In the afternoon, I get the cold shoulder from almost everyone. I skip lunch and go for a run.
