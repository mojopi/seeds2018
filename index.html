            <hr> At a camp on a lake in Maine, mayflies molt on pines. They shed their skins to grow and re-make themselves.
            <br>
            <br>We too come to this camp to grow. Connected by the vast differences between us, we change with each other.
            <br>
            <br> We're Palestinian, Israeli, Egyptian, Jordanian, Pakistani, Indian, and American. For three weeks, we live, work, play, and are in constant conversation with each other. We hear each other's stories. We cry together. We laugh together. We wear the same green t-shirts, eat the same food, and sleep in bunks next to each other. On a small plot of land, our worlds and identities clash and come together to make something new.
            <br>
            <br> The relationships that grow here make us more human — more alive to each other's sufferings, humiliations, idiosyncracies, habits, and joys. In coming to know each other, we also come to know ourselves — our powers, biases, values, privileges, and the traumas we carry.
            <br>
            <br>I tried to capture some of moments that struck me during our three weeks together in 2018. Click on the sketches below to get a sense of some conversations and memories that I've been carrying with me.

I   agreed that the U.S. is an imperial power that had destroyed other countries, destabilized regions, and whose actions have resulted in the destruction of millions lives (e.g. the Iraq War), however, I shared my skepticism about their ideas about the U.S. having a literal Deep State that was conneted to American Jews. I talked about larger incentive structures, issues of campaign finance, Super PACs, andthe power of Evangelicals in America." + "<br>" + "<br>" +

A Palestian woman talks about the death of the seed, she knows his sister. He was shot in the neck at point-blank range, she says, by an Israeli soldier. An women from Israel corrects her. He was killed by a police officer. To the Palestinians, that is a technicality, the mention of which shows a lack of caring about the boy's death." + "<br>" + "<br>" + "The next day, in dialogue, we talk about the incident.

Our moment of pride is cut short when the counselors say it doesn't count. They point to one person who's sitting out. It's a gotcha. She was uncomfortable and their rules are totally arbitrary anyway. We react. We fight amongst ourselves." + "<br>" + "<br>"
